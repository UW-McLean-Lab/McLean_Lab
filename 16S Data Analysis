This basic workflow is used for amplicon 16S rRNA Data analysis for paried-end reads generated on an Illumina MiSeq.

Raw reads are imported into Qiime2 (Python, v. 2019.1) 
https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/importing/

Reads are filtered using the DADA2 plugin within the Qiime2 suite
https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/plugins/available/dada2/

A trained classfier using the 16S rRNA Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD, v. 15.1) assigns 
Taxonomy to raw reads within Qiime2
https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.1/tutorials/feature-classifier/

Data is then exported from Qiime2 and imported into R in which multiple packages are used to analyze the data, 
including but not limited to:
phyloseq, clustivs, ggplot2, ampvis2, vegan, and ade4.

R scripts are provided under the "R_scripts_for_16S_analysis" folder.

Example .biom, metadata, and tree files are also provided under the "files" folder.

This workflow was used in the recent paper:
