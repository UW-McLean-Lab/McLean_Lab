Here we provide tools and workflows for investigating the Oral Microbiome though the use of multi-omic stratagies including:
- Meta-genomics (WGS)
- Meta-transcriptomics (RNAseq)
- Proteomics and Metabolomics
- Amplicon Sequencing 

We have also developed and Nextflow worklows for some of our pipelines that are optimized for running on AWS-Batch:
- MIDAS https://github.com/kkerns85/midas_nextflow
- BINSANITY (under development: https://github.com/kkerns85/BINSANITY)
